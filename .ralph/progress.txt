## next-themes
- Installed next-themes package
- Wrapped app with ThemeProvider in app/layout.tsx (attribute="class", defaultTheme="dark", enableSystem=false)
- Added suppressHydrationWarning to html element to prevent flash
- Removed hardcoded className="dark" from html element (now managed by next-themes)
- Files changed: app/layout.tsx, package.json

## theme-toggle
- Created components/theme-toggle.tsx
- Uses useTheme from next-themes, Sun/Moon icons from lucide-react
- Uses CSS classes (hidden/block dark:hidden/dark:block) for icon switching to avoid hydration mismatch
- Files changed: components/theme-toggle.tsx
