- Toggle and Run Now actions with per-job loading states (using Set<string> for tracking)
- Loading, error, and empty states matching database-viewer patterns
- Uses lucide-react icons: ToggleLeft/ToggleRight for enable/disable, Play for run, Loader2 for loading
- Files changed: components/cron-viewer.tsx (new)

## logs-api (completed)
- Created app/api/logs/route.ts as Server-Sent Events endpoint
- Uses child_process.spawn to run `tail -n 100 -f ~/.clawdbot/logs/gateway.log`
- Streams stdout lines as SSE `data:` events, stderr as `event: error` events
- Sends initial `: connected` SSE comment on connection
- Handles client disconnect via ReadableStream cancel() to kill tail process
- Uses `force-dynamic` export to prevent static optimization
- Files changed: app/api/logs/route.ts (new)

## logs-ui (completed)
- Created components/logs-viewer.tsx with real-time log streaming UI
- Connects to /api/logs using EventSource for SSE streaming

- Pause/Resume button disconnects/reconnects EventSource
- Clear button to reset log lines
- Keeps last 100 lines max, trimming older entries
- Connection status indicator (green/gray dot)
- Loading and empty states matching other viewer components
- Files changed: components/logs-viewer.tsx (new)

## system-api (completed)
- Created app/api/system/route.ts - GET returns {cpu, ram: {used, total, percent}, disk: {used, total, percent}, uptime}
- CPU: reads /proc/stat twice (0.5s apart) to calculate real CPU usage percentage
- RAM: uses Node os.totalmem()/os.freemem() for memory stats
- Disk: runs `df -B1 /` to get disk usage in bytes, converts to GB
- Uptime: uses os.uptime() for system uptime in seconds
- All values rounded to 1 decimal place, graceful fallback to 0 on errors
- Follows existing API patterns (NextResponse.json, try/catch, Promise.all for concurrent ops)
- Files changed: app/api/system/route.ts (new)

## system-ui (completed)
- Created components/system-stats.tsx with system resource monitoring UI
- Fetches /api/system on mount and every 5s (auto-refresh)

- Labels show percentage and GB used/total
- Server uptime formatted as "X days, Y hours, Z minutes"
- Loading, error states matching other viewer component patterns
- Used custom progress bar instead of adding shadcn Progress component (simpler, no new dependency)
- Files changed: components/system-stats.tsx (new)
